About the dataset-

The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) is a leading consulting organization providing policy advice, strategic insights, and consulting services to governments and universities to improve educational and research outcomes.

Since 2012, CWUR has been publishing the only academic ranking of global universities that assesses the quality of education, alumni employment, research output, and citations without relying on surveys and university data submissions. The ranking started out as a project in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with the aim of rating the top 100 world universities. It was quickly reported worldwide by universities and the media and many requests were received to expand it. In 2019, the ranking expanded to list the top 2000 out of twenty thousand universities worldwide, making it the largest academic ranking of global universities.

In this repository, I tried analysing the different factors that contributed to a university being given that particular rank. Visualizations for easy and better analysis are also added.
